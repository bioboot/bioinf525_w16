# Software Requirements & Setup Instructions
To fully participate in this course you will need access to the software described below on *your own laptop* (N.B. You will likely need _Administer privileges/permissions_ to install some of these). 

<br>

**Supported web browser**
We require an up-to-date [supported web browser](https://help.github.com/articles/supported-browsers/) (current versions of Chrome, Firefox and Safari are preferred). 

<br>

**R and RStudio:**
You will require access R and RStudio on your own laptop during Module 2 of this course.  R is a system for statistical computation and graphics. We use R in this course for several reasons:

- R is open-source and freely available for Mac, PC, and Linux machines. This means that there is no restriction on having to license a particular software program, or have students work in a specific lab that has been outfitted with the technology of choice. 
- R is user-extensible and user extensions can easily be made available to others. 
- R is commercial quality. It is the package of choice for many statisticians and those who use statistics frequently. 
- R is very popular in the field of bioinformatics, especially in certain sub-disciplines, like genomics and structural bioinformatics.  
- R is very powerful. Furthermore, it is gaining new features every day. New statistical methods are often available first in R. 

**RStudio**
RStudio is an easy to use alternative interface to R that can be installed as an application on your own laptop.  RStudio is available from <http://www.rstudio.org>

<br>

**For motivated instructors only: Git and GitHub**  
Git is a version control system that lets you track who made changes to what and when.  GitHub is a popular social code-hosting platform that greatly facilitates collaborative content development.  

To learn more about the basics of Git and GitHub see [Day4 of our Biocomputing Bootcamp course](http://bioboot.github.io/web-2015/day4/).  For details on contributing via git/GitHub to our GitHub hosted website please see this [README](https://github.com/bioboot/bioinf525_w16).

### Praise for the 2015 class from official student evaluations

> Until now I've only fantasized about courses like this. Lectures extremely well organized, designed with true empathy for students who lack the decades of experience of the instructor. Homework induces us to review important points without sucking up time. The practice and creativity and problem solving of bioinformatics are up to us to cultivate, this course was excellent to give us the groundwork to apply the available resources to what we need. I actually learned IN class, instead of just making notes saying "look up XYZ". Time in lectures was NOT wasted---none of the "We'll go through this fast because it's not really important" that can be heard in other courses.... Many thanks, a great experience, very useful intro to the field.

> I think the lab portions that were guided to understand the different online software was extremely helpful. Not only for other science classes but also for lab work and searching in general. I think these are great skills to learn.

> Relevant! Clarified so much that is discussed offhandedly in other courses.

> The amount of material in lecture and lab was just about right for a survey course like this! A lot of good background information, and resources to look further into things that may be useful.

> Really helpful course. Helped me understand databases used in research very well. I definitely feel more confident about using those databases and getting the output that I want. The causal atmosphere of the class was great and really festered a learning environment. GREAT CLASS!!!

> I think the learning about the software was about right. We got a little exposure to the math behind the model and how to operate this model on the computer. Both good and valuable to learn.

> Course format EXCELLENT. Step-by-step lab guides are super useful when you don't have a background/natural intuition in genetics and bioinformatics. Very much appreciated!

> Overall fantastic course, I think the lecturers did a good job of introducing and getting across the concepts and ideas.


> The surveys were helpful and good for reviewing the topics presented in lecture. The readings weren't necessary to understand the lecture material but were helpful, nonetheless.

> I liked the homework format as it encouraged me to review the information.

> Easy and helpful.

> very good instructor, answered questions well, was always available and encouraged a casual environment in the class that helped in learning the material and discussing problems with the faculty as well as with other students.
