# Software Requirements & Setup Instructions
To fully participate in this course you will need access to the software described below on *your own laptop* (N.B. You will likely need _Administer privileges/permissions_ to install some of these). 

<br>

**Supported web browser**
We require an up-to-date [supported web browser](https://help.github.com/articles/supported-browsers/) (current versions of Chrome, Firefox and Safari are preferred). 

<br>

**R and RStudio:**
You will require access R and RStudio on your own laptop during Module 2 of this course.  R is a system for statistical computation and graphics. We use R in this course for several reasons:

- R is open-source and freely available for Mac, PC, and Linux machines. This means that there is no restriction on having to license a particular software program, or have students work in a specific lab that has been outfitted with the technology of choice. 
- R is user-extensible and user extensions can easily be made available to others. 
- R is commercial quality. It is the package of choice for many statisticians and those who use statistics frequently. 
- R is very popular in the field of bioinformatics, especially in certain sub-disciplines, like genomics and structural bioinformatics.  
- R is very powerful. Furthermore, it is gaining new features every day. New statistical methods are often available first in R. 

**RStudio**
RStudio is an easy to use alternative interface to R that can be installed as an application on your own laptop.  RStudio is available from <http://www.rstudio.org>

<br>

**For motivated instructors only: Git and GitHub**  
Git is a version control system that lets you track who made changes to what and when.  GitHub is a popular social code-hosting platform that greatly facilitates collaborative content development.  

To learn more about the basics of Git and GitHub see [Day4 of our Biocomputing Bootcamp course](http://bioboot.github.io/web-2015/day4/).  For details on contributing via git/GitHub to our GitHub hosted website please see this [README](https://github.com/bioboot/bioinf525_w16).
