<p>This page collects together all of the “assessments” associated with individual modules.</p>

<p>In this site, assessments represent the <em>results</em> of performing assessment activities, not the assessments themselves.  (Usually, you don’t want to publish the actual assessment instruments (i.e. the tests) on the course website!)</p>

<p>Publishing assessment results enable students to see how well they did compared to others.  It also allows the instructor to provide feedback about the assessment activity.</p>
