## BIOINF 525: Foundations of Bioinformatics and Systems Biology

## Course Goals:
BIOINF 525 will introduce students to the fundamental principles and practices of bioinformatics and systems biology. The course will cover integrating and accessing molecular biology resources, bioinformatics support of genome sequencing projects, analysis of sequence variations, gene expression data, protein-protein interactions, pathways and networks. The broader goal is to point towards perspectives that bioinformatics can expose for the integration and analysis of complex biological information. Applications in translational medicine and cell biology will be highlighted. 
 

## Module #1 Description:
This module provides an introduction to practical issues of computer-based handling and interpretation of genomic and related datasets. We specifically target bioinformatics software and data resources freely available on the internet. 

A familiarity with basic biomedical concepts will be useful, as well as basic knowledge of computer usage. No programing skills are needed.


## Schedule:
Lectures on Tuesdays*, 2:30 - 4:00 PM
Rm. 2062 Palmer Commons Bldg [Map]

[*Note: first class day is Tuesday, Jan. 12]
