# Module 1. Foundations of Bioinformatics

Bioinformatics is driving the collection, analysis and interpretation of big data in the biosciences.  This module provides an introduction to practical issues of computer-based handling and interpretation of biomolecular and genomic datasets.  We specifically target bioinformatics software and data resources freely available on the Internet.
